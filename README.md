## Music React player that stores static list of songs and have next features: 
### - controls (play/pause, prev/next buttons);
### - volume and progress bars (you can drag volume bar and click on progress bar to skip through song);
### - list of liked songs (you can like song by pressing on like button);
### - search bar to find a song by name or by artist.

### This project helped me better understand the main react hooks such as useState, useContext, useEffect, useRef;
